                  <h3>Characteristics of Arabic or Hebrew (compared to other languages)</h3>
                  <p>
                    Middle Eastern languages such as Hebrew and Arabic are written predominantly right-to-left (RTL). Consequently, user interfaces require a different layout than those targeted at left-to-right (LTR) reading audiences. The direction of writing influences how information should be placed on the screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The main flow of the page goes in RTL direction, in other words, mirrored relative to English. The script may contain numbers and Latin words that are still written LTR. Most of the icons are not mirrored (there are some special cases that will be discussed later), but they should be listed in RTL order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For more details about the bidirectional (BiDi) nature of Arabic and Hebrew, see

                <h4>General recommendations</h4>
                    <p>
                      Regardless of whether you can read the language you are testing, it is always a good practice to open English and non-English UI side by side to be able to compare UI and quickly locate a necessary tool or command. It may be two virtual machine (VM) windows or two web-browser windows positioned side by side. Another helpful trick for languages you can’t read is to use the Google Translate app by pointing your smartphone’s camera at text to translate it.

                <h4>Testing on ArcGIS Pro and Desktop</h4>
                    <p>
                      For ArcGIS Pro and Desktop, install Hebrew and Arabic LPs for Desktop products. Test Arabic using VMs that should be either deployed by a tester or connect to an Arabic VM from the public inventory to test with it. In case VMs resources are exhausted, MUI can be applied for testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hebrew testing can be done using English OS, but you must set the user and system locale to Hebrew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is recommended that you open one window of a VM with an Arabic or Hebrew version of the product you are testing and compare it side by side with an English version opened on your desktop or another VM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To get a VM, see <a href="https://ecsprd.esri.com/" target="_blank">https://ecsprd.esri.com/</a>.
                    </p>

                <h4>Testing web apps</h4>
                    <p>
                      To test web apps, you don’t need to run a Hebrew or Arabic VM. If needed, you can test in English VM on your regular machine. It is recommended that you open English UI in one browser window or tab and Arabic or Hebrew UI in another browser window or tab. Positioning windows with two different languages side by side allows you to compare UI and quickly locate what you need to test. While you can set the browser language independently from Windows OS, the Safari browser depends on the Mac OS language, so you must change the OS language if you need to test in Safari.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some web applications, such as Map Viewer, support a locale property where you can switch the language for testing. For instance, adding ‘&locale=ar’ at the end of the URL will change the page language to Arabic, but it only works if you stay on that page.
                    </p>

                <h4>Testing web applications in mobile mode</h4>
                    <p>
                      If physical mobile devices are not available, some UI mobile testing can also be performed with developer mode or just smaller window size in desktop browsers, but it is highly recommended that you use physical devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Mobile apps usually rely on the OS language. That means that to test a mobile app with Arabic or Hebrew language, you need to change your device language and region.

              <h3>Pseudo versus real translations</h3>
                    <p>
                      For testing for UI elements, like layout direction, buttons, icons, tools order, and to find hard-coded strings, you don't need to wait for real translation; pseudo translations are fine. To check for other UI issues like truncation, overlapping, text justification, word wrap, and so on,, you must wait for real translations, because the mixed nature of English and localized characters in pseudo translation may produce false alarms.

              <h3>Main differences between Hebrew and Arabic</h3>

                    <p>
                      The following details the main differences between the two languages.
                    </p>

                <h4>Numerals</h4>
                  <p>
                    Hebrew uses Western numerals in UI and technical literature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some locales of Arabic language (AR-Egypt) may use Indic numerals instead of Western numerals. In web apps, all numerals are expected to be Western. Desktop and mobile apps may use Indic numerals from the operational system. To learn more, see <a href="https://i18n.esri.com/website/html/RTL/index.html#intro_6" target="_blank">Numerals and math</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is a good practice to allow users to choose the numeral systems to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes you can see a mixture of Western and Indic numbers within a panel or an input box, but it is a bug. Numbers should be consistent.
                  </p>

                  <figure>
                        <img src="img/mixtureIndic.png" style="width: 600px;"><br>
                      <figcaption>An example of mixture of Western (green boxes) and Indic (red boxes) numerals within a panel. All numerals should be either only Western, either only Indic. The combination of Indic digits and Western digit (nested red box) in the input box is inacceptable.</figcaption>
                  </figure>

                <h4>Percent sign</h4>
                  <p>
                    The percent sign position is left of the number (%100) in Arabic, and right of the number (100%) in Hebrew. For Indic numerals, a special character for the percent symbol may be used (٪١٠٠).
                  </p>

                  <dfn>
                        Note: In the Turkish language, the percent sign also goes to the left (%100).
                  </dfn>

                <h4>Question mark</h4>
                  <p>

                    <p>
                      It is incorrect to think that because Arabic and Hebrew are right-to-left languages, all UI should be the same as in English, just mirrored. Actually, those languages are bidirectional, and testers must be aware of what to mirror and what not to mirror.

                      <h4>Text display in Arabic and Hebrew</h4>
                        <p>
                          Both Hebrew and Arabic alphabets have 24 characters. Some characters should be written differently depending on their position in the word (beginning, middle, end and stand-alone). If Arabic text is displayed as disjoined characters, it is a bug.
                        </p>

                              Numbers, English names, and citations within the RTL text are written in LTR direction within the text flow. Stand-alone English text may be right-aligned, in general going in a LTR direction. Punctuation is so-called weak characters, and they are placed at the end of the string on the left. In this example, the tester has wrapped part of a HE expression into the LTR tag to overwrite the browser default behavior that was incorrectly rearranging the string word order:

The result string is displayed like this : 2019/12/31. Sometimes browser may reorder it incorrectly, sticking the year to the day, something like this: 312019/12/. It is a bug.

                          Sometimes English text with punctuation may look not very good in RTL layouts. There is no way to control the direction of user-defined text that may be typed in any language. For UI text coded by our developers, it is better to control the punctuation in Always English text like product names. If the developer is not sure how to do it, use LTR tags to prevent browsers from moving punctuation to inappropriate positions.

                        The X and Y coordinates are written in pairs (X, Y) in a mathematical format to represent the x- axis and y-axis. While cartographers write spherical coordinates in reverse order, latitude (Y) is first and then longitude (X). Coincidently, this is the correct reading direction for Arabic users, (Y, X) if you intend to use Y,X to represent that the same location in mathematical format.

                        <em>Note:</em> Not all countries use N/S/E/W notation similar to English. Abbreviations in native characters are widely used in Russia, Thailand, Japan, and many other countries with non-Latin alphabets. Often those abbreviations of hemispheres are followed by abbreviations for latitude and longitude, so more than one character is required for each coordinate notation. Countries where Arabic is used refer to the cardinal directions as Ash Shamaliyah (N), Al Gharbiyah (W), Ash Sharqiyah (E), and Al Janobiyah (S). Additionally, Al Wusta is used for the center. For instance, N is written in AR as ثوانی

                        While tools within their panels are following their LTR or RTL order, there is an exclusion. Widgets within the map frame are always positioned the same, no matter RTL or LTR.

                    Circular progress indicators derive their directionality from analog clocks and always turn in the clockwise direction.

                    Everything imitating physical devices, like MP3 and MP4 players, goes LTR. Note that text under the animation timescale in the following example is correctly written in RTL direction for Arabic (right), compared to English (left):

                  <p>
                    It is not recommended to flip the map frame and widget positions inside the map (Home, Zoom in, Zoom out, North Arrow, Scalebar, and so on). The app author must rearrange the widget positions if  needed for the design purposes. See the following example:

                    The verbal scale text should go in RTL direction.

                <h4>Map legends should respect LTR or RTL direction</h4>
                  <p>
                    While in LTR languages, legend patches go to the left; in AR and HE they are usually right-aligned. In ArcGIS Pro, Desktop, and some web apps, there is an option for a cartographer to choose between positioning legend patches at the left or at the right for all languages if it is needed for cartographical purposes.

                    Examples are vertical separators between windows and right-align and left-align buttons.

                  <p>
                    Testing languages like AR and HE may seem tricky, but as long as you are aware of major key points, you can focus on them and perform manual testing successfully, regardless of whether you can read those languages.
